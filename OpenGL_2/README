Nathan Bosch (s3475344) and Winward Fang (s3205843)

We both took the course last year, but implemented things from scratch. We also added several additional features (listed at the end of the readme).

Uses Qt 5.5.1. Was built on linux on the school computers.
If the default kit is not 5.5.1, go to projects, manage kits, select Desktop (under Manual) and change the Qt version to 5.5.1. Apply and click OK.

FILES CHANGED: mainview.h, mainview.cpp, 
FILES ADDED: vertshader_normal.glsl, vertshader_phong.glsl, vertshader_gouraud.glsl, fragshader_normal.glsl, fragshader_phong.glsl, fragshader_gouraud.glsl

Assignment changes:
1. Normal Shader (1 point)
 - We implemented the normal shader by loading in the normals from the model and drawing this as the color in the shaders
2. Selecting Shaders (0.5 point)
