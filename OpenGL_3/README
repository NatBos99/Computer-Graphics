Nathan Bosch (s3475344) and Winward Fang (s3205843)

We both took the course last year, but implemented things from scratch.

Uses Qt 5.5.1. Was built on linux on the school computers.
If the default kit is not 5.5.1, go to projects, manage kits, select Desktop (under Manual) and change the Qt version to 5.5.1. Apply and click OK.

Assignment changes:
Rotating a Model (1 point)
 - We store the angles and rotation vectors for every object and rotate the object by that amount every frame
Animating a Scene (3 points)
 - We use three different meshes, two textures, and four objects. We have a cat, cube, and two spheres. The cube and spheres use
   the RUG logo texture, whereas the cat uses the standard cat texture. The cat and the bottom sphere rotate by themselves,
   whereas the top sphere is bouncing in place and the cube is rotating in place (through sin translations).
 - We implement (or simulate) camera movement by allowing the user to rotate the objects around an axis (so all sides of the objects can be seen).
 - The zooming is implemented by moving the objects closer to the camera.
